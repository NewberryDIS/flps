Rebuild of 2007 version of FLPS.  Uses react.js on the front end; node/express + mysql on the back end.  

Original FLPS XML files were converted to more traditional json via python scripts found in /python.  TEI XML is not used in this version, however that XML can be found [here](https://github.com/santheo/FLPS-data).  

This site is in need of maintenance, and Some Day We Will Have Timeâ„¢.
